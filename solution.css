The solution involves replacing the wildcard selector with more specific selectors that target only the intended elements.  For example, if you want to apply the style only to elements with class `item` within the `.container`, use the following:

```css
.container > .item {
  color: blue;
}
```
This prevents the unintended consequences of applying the style to all children. In addition, consider using more specific selectors or class names for better control over your styles. This improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of unexpected side effects when the structure of your HTML changes.
